            <p>
                <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. <i>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> passages,
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including versions of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b></i>.

            <h2>Parágrafo 2</h2>
            <p>
                <i>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is
                    that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                    'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</i> Many desktop
                publishing packages and web page editors now use <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> as their default
                model text, and a search for '<b>lorem ipsum</b>' will uncover many web sites still in
                their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
